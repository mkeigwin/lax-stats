# Basic outline of the site
to run you'll need to add the hidden files, not using them at the moment but if we add user name and password we'll use them to hide them

files to add

.env
===> inside of it add this line

Password=HOLDER

.gitingnore
===> inside of it add these 2 lines

node_modules/

.env


after you add those two files, go into your command line and navigate to the place you have this file in. then type the following in,
npm i
nodemon
then go onto chrome or whatever and type this in browswer to see
http://localhost:3000/



***Instead of showing all or only a few, could increase the number of scores shown by a certain number everytime by changing the howMuchShow variable in the eventListeners
